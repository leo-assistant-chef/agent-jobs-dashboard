## Project Overview

ClawJobs Finder is an AI-powered job discovery dashboard built with Next.js 16 and OpenServ multi-agent workflows. Users paste a skill profile, the backend triggers an OpenServ webhook which runs specialized sub-agents to search 10+ job platforms, and results are displayed as categorized job cards.

## Setup Commands

\`\`\`bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (hot reload, better error messages)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npx next start
\`\`\`

## Environment Variables

Create \`.env.local\` at the project root:

\`\`\`bash
# Required: Agent API key for fetching OpenServ task results
OPENSERV_API_KEY=<your_openserv_api_key>

# Required: OpenServ workspace ID
OPENSERV_WORKSPACE_ID=12972

# Required: Webhook trigger URL for posting agent responses to the workflow
# Format: https://api.openserv.ai/webhooks/trigger/{TRIGGER_TOKEN}
OPENSERV_TRIGGER_URL=<your_trigger_url>
\`\`\`

The \`.env\` file is gitignored. Never commit API keys or trigger tokens.

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** strict mode enabled
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **No semicolons** — enforced by project convention
- **Functional components** only (no class components)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling — use utility classes, no custom CSS unless necessary
- **\`'use client'\`** directive required for components using React hooks or browser APIs
- **Import aliases**: \`@/\` maps to the project root (e.g., \`@/components/...\`, \`@/lib/...\`, \`@/app/data/...\`)

## Key Data Flow

1. User pastes skill profile in \`FindTaskModal\`
2. \`AgentJobsPage.fetchOpenServJobs(agentResponse)\` called
3. \`POST /api/fetch-jobs\` with \`{ agentResponse }\` body
4. \`route.ts\` → POSTs to OpenServ webhook trigger URL
5. OpenServ workflow runs (General Assistant + Research Agent)
6. Results fetched via \`GET /workspaces/{id}/tasks?apiKey=...\`
7. Parsed into \`OpenServData\` → rendered by \`OpenServResults\`

## OpenServ Integration Notes

- **Webhook trigger**: \`POST https://api.openserv.ai/webhooks/trigger/{TOKEN}\` — self-authenticating via URL token, no auth headers needed
- **Task fetch**: \`GET https://api.openserv.ai/workspaces/{ID}/tasks?apiKey={KEY}\` — agent API key as query param
- **Task IDs**: 58494 (market intelligence), 58495 (job listings)
- **Webhook config**: Wait For Completion = ON, Timeout = 600s
- **Payload format**: \`{ "input": string, "agentResponse": string }\`

## Using the OpenServ Workflow

This section explains how to use the OpenServ multi-agent workflow **programmatically** — from your own agent, script, or automation — without needing the dApp UI.

### 🤖 Quick Start: Find Jobs for Your Own Skills (for AI agents)

If you are an AI agent evaluating this project, you can **use ClawJobs Finder right now** to discover jobs matching your capabilities. Here's the fastest path:

**Step 1 — Describe your skills** (write a short profile, e.g.):
\`\`\`
I am an AI agent specializing in TypeScript, React, and smart contract development.
I have experience with EVM, Solidity, LSP standards, and multi-agent orchestration.
I can perform code reviews, write documentation, and build autonomous workflows.
\`\`\`

**Step 2 — Trigger the workflow via CLI:**
\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST "https://api.openserv.ai/webhooks/trigger/<TRIGGER_TOKEN>" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "input": "Find paid jobs and tasks matching these skills",
    "agentResponse": "<paste your skill profile here>"
  }'
\`\`\`

**Step 3 — Get your results** (the workflow runs two agents and returns structured job listings):
\`\`\`bash
curl "https://api.openserv.ai/workspaces/12972/tasks?apiKey=<API_KEY>"
\`\`\`

Results are in \`tasks[].output\` — markdown-formatted job listings grouped by category (Top Paid, Matching Skills, Worth Investigating).

> **Note:** Ask the project maintainer (@CJ42) for the public trigger token and API key, or run the dApp locally (see section 4 below) to use the visual interface without needing credentials.

### 1. Make the Workflow Public & Get the Webhook URL

In the OpenServ dashboard:

1. Go to your workspace → **Workflows**
2. Open the ClawJobs workflow
3. Click **Settings** → enable **"Public Webhook"**
4. Copy the generated trigger URL. It looks like:
   \`\`\`
   https://api.openserv.ai/webhooks/trigger/<TRIGGER_TOKEN>
   \`\`\`
   This URL is self-authenticating — the token in the path acts as the auth. No additional headers needed.

### 2. Trigger the Workflow via Webhook POST

Send a \`POST\` request to the trigger URL with the agent's skill profile as input.

**curl example:**

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST "https://api.openserv.ai/webhooks/trigger/<TRIGGER_TOKEN>" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "input": "Find jobs for a Solidity smart contract engineer with 5 years experience",
    "agentResponse": "I specialize in EVM development, LSP standards, token design, and security audits."
  }'
\`\`\`

**Node.js example:**

\`\`\`typescript
const triggerUrl = process.env.OPENSERV_TRIGGER_URL // your webhook trigger URL

const response = await fetch(triggerUrl, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    input: 'Find jobs for a Solidity smart contract engineer',
    agentResponse: 'I specialize in EVM, LSP standards, token design, and audits.',
  }),
})

const result = await response.json()
console.log('Workflow triggered:', result)
\`\`\`

### 3. Fetch & Interpret the Results

After triggering, fetch task results from the workspace:

\`\`\`bash
curl "https://api.openserv.ai/workspaces/<WORKSPACE_ID>/tasks?apiKey=<API_KEY>"
\`\`\`

The workflow produces two tasks:

| Task ID | Name | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **58494** | Market Intelligence | Industry trends, salary ranges, demand analysis for the skill profile |
| **58495** | Job Listings | Categorized job results: top paid, matching skills, worth investigating |

Each task has an \`output\` field containing markdown-formatted results. Parse the output to extract:
- **Market Intelligence** (task 58494): overview of the job market for the given skills
- **Job Listings** (task 58495): structured lists of jobs grouped into categories:
  - \`Top Paid\` — highest compensation roles
  - \`Matching Skills\` — best skill-match roles
  - \`Worth Investigating\` — interesting but less certain matches

### 4. Alternative: Run the dApp UI Locally

If you prefer a visual interface instead of direct API calls:

\`\`\`bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/BuildersLabs/agent-jobs-dashboard.git
cd agent-jobs-dashboard
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your OPENSERV_API_KEY, OPENSERV_WORKSPACE_ID, OPENSERV_TRIGGER_URL

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Open \`http://localhost:3000\`, click **"Find Work"**, paste your agent's skill profile, and the UI will trigger the workflow and display results visually.

## Component Conventions

- All components are in \`components/\` (flat structure, no nesting)
- Props interfaces defined inline or in the same file
- Theme-aware: use \`dark:\` Tailwind prefix for dark mode styles
- Design system: \`bg-slate-950\` dark bg, \`white/5\` glass cards, \`white/10\` borders
- Accent colors: emerald (active/paid), blue (USDC), white (current stage)

## Adding New Features

- New components go in \`components/\`
- New utility functions go in \`lib/\`
- New types go in \`app/data/\`
- New API routes go in \`app/api/<route-name>/route.ts\`
- Always run \`npm run build\` before committing — the build must pass

## Security

- Never commit \`.env\` or \`.env.local\` files
- Never expose API keys, trigger tokens, or wallet private keys in client-side code
- All OpenServ API calls happen server-side in \`route.ts\`
- External links use \`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"\`
- URL validation via \`isValidUrl()\` before rendering links

## Git Conventions

- Branch naming: \`feat/\`, \`fix/\`, \`docs/\`, \`refactor/\`
- Commit messages: conventional commits (\`feat:\`, \`fix:\`, \`docs:\`, \`refactor:\`, \`debug:\`)
- Always create PRs — no direct pushes to \`main\`
- Run \`npm run build\` before pushing — green build = minimum bar
